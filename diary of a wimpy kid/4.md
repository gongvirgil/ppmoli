#  Friday, September 10th

Yesterday was the first day of P.E. and we started the football unit. The first thing I did was sneak off to the basketball courts and check to see if the cheese was still where it was at the end of last school year, and sure enough it was.

That thing has been sitting on the court since at least last fall and it has coused a whole lot of trouble. It's all moldy and nasty, and ever since it showed up, people have been trying  to avoid it.

To give you an idea of how people will go out of their way to stay away from the cheese, it's sitting right under the only hoop with a net in it but nobody's played on that court for a year.

Darnell Washington tripped and fell and brushed the cheese with his finger last year and started this whole thing called the Cheese Touch. It's basically like Cooties, where if you get touched with the Cheese Touch then you have it until you pass it on somebody else.

The only way to protect yourself from the Cheese Touch was to cross your fingers. But it was really hard to remember to keep your fingers crossed all the time, especially when whoever had the Cheese Touch was looking for his next victim.

So I taped my fingers together for the last couple weeks of school. I ended up getting a "D" in handwriting but it was totally worth it.

This one kid named Abe Hall got the Cheese Touch in April and nobody would even sit at the same table with him at lunch for the whole rest of the year.

This summer he moved away to California and he took the Cheese Touch with him. Nobody has touched the cheese since then, not even with a stick.
