# Saturday, September 18th

Today I got out of bed early because the vacuuming thing was more than I could handle. I watched cartoons for a while but then I remembered the other reason I don't get up early on Saturdays. With Dad doing his chores all around you it makes you feel guilty and takes all the joy out of just laying around doing nothing.

Tonight I'm going to spend the night at Rowley's. It;s a pretty big deal because I haven't spent the night over there in something like a year and a half.

The main reason I haven't slept over there in so long is because Rowley's dad really doesn't like me.

It all goes back to something that happened last June. We were watching some corny movie Rowley had where there were these kids that taught themselves a secret language that only they could understand.

Me and Rowley thought the whole secret language thing was pretty cool but we couldn't figure out how to do it like the kids on the movie.

So we decided to make up our own secret language and we tried it out over dinner.

Well, Rowley's dad must have cracked our code because the next thing I knew, I was going home early.

And that was the last time I was invited for a sleepover.

So I don't know why Mr. Jefferson is giving me a second chance. Either he's gotten over the whole secret language thing or he's just forgotten why he doesn't like me.
