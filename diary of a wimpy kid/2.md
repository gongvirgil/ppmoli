# Wednesday, September 8th

This morning Mom made me lend my borther Rodrick some of my money so he could buy lunch, which really stunk. I'm still mad at Rodrick for the trick he pulled on me at the beginning of the summer so I'm really not looking to do him any favors.

What happened was that on the first day of summer vacation, he woke me up in the middle of the night dressed up in his school clothes. He told me I slept through the whole summer but that luckily I had woken up in time for the first day of school.

You might think I'm pretty dumb for falling for that one, but I was too groggy to know any better and plus Rodrick had set my clock ahead and pulled the blinds shut.

So I just got up and got dressed and went downstairs to fix myself some breakfast. I must've made a big racket because the next thing I knew Dad was in my face wondering what the heck I was doing eating Cheerios at 3 a.m.

The thing about Dad when he comes downstairs late at night is that he's always just wearing a tee shirt and some boxer shorts. I don't know which is worse, getting yelled at our having to see your father in his underwear.

I keep meaning to ask him to please put on some more clothes the next time he come downstairs but the right opportunity never comes up.

Anyway it took me a couple of minutes to figure our what all was going on. When I told Dad Rodrick tricked me Dad stomped on down to Rodrick's room in the basement and I followed along.

I was pretty excited to finally see Rodrick get what was coming to him.

But when we got down there Rodrick had covered up his tracks pretty good and you would never know he had been up to something.

Dad just threw up his hands and went back up to bed. So now Dad thought I was an idiot AND a liar.

Come to think of it ever since then Dad has been real suspicious around me, like I'm turning into a bad kid or something.

I'll put it to you this way... if I'm going to do something bad and take the heat like I did that night you better believe I'm going to come up with something a lot more satisfying than
eating a bowl of Cheerios in the middle of the night.
