# Sunday, September 12th

Today was a really bad day. Dad ended up running into Mr. Swann at church and Mr. Swann was telling Dad how great Bishop Garrigan High School is, where his son Dan goes.

Dad seemed REAL interested, which is a very bad sign for me. Now I'm sure Bishop Garrigan is a fine school and all that except for the fact that it is ALL BOYS. Number one I want to go to Crossland High School where there are boys AND girls and number two I wouldn't survive the first day at Bishop Garrigan.

Rodrick doesn't have to worry about getting sent to Bishop Garrigan because he is already a junior at Crossland, but I had definitely better figure a way out of this.

Mr. Swann went on and on about how Bishop Garrigan makes "men" out of boys. And from the way Dad kept looking over at me I knew I was in trouble. It doesn't help that Mr. Swann has three boys who are the same ages as us Heffley boys, and Dad's carpool passed by their house every night.

As far as the whole "making men out of boys" idea goes, I think the Swann boys have a pretty good head start.

I've still got two years before I go to high school, and hoplefully Dad will forget about Bishop Garrigan by then.

But if things look bad down the road I better start working on Mom to change my fate.
