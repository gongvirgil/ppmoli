You know how I said Mom is always taking Manny's side? Well today was some more proof of that.

I made Manny his cereal like I always do, but this time I accidentally poured the milk in before the cereal. And when I poured the cereal in on top of that, Manny just about lost his mind. He made a huge racket, crying and hollering and all that, and Mom came down to see what was going on. So I told her waht happened and I figured she would just tell Manny to pipe down and eat his stupid cereal.

But instead she says "I wouldn't eat it either." And then she gives Manny a big hug and makes me pour him a new bowl of cereal, this time in the right order.

I guess I should've expected it. A couple weeks ago when Manny was at daycare he opened up his lunchbox and when he took out his sandwich he had a fit because it was cut in two halves, not four squares like he usually gets it. So the daycare people had to call Mom up at work to get her to come over so Manny would calm down.
