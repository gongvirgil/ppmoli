# Saturday, September 11th

Well the first week of school is finally over so I can sleep late again. Most kids set their alarms and get up early on Saturday morning to watch cartoons or whatever, but not me. The way I know it's time for me to crawl out of bed is when I can't stand the taste of my breath anymore.

Unfortunately Dad wakes up at 6:00 in the morning no matter what day it is and he is not real considerate of the fact that I am trying to enjoy my Saturday.

Other than the Saturday morning vacuuming me and Dad get along pretty good. But Rodrick and Dad is another story. It doesn't help that Rodrick is a teenager, which is Dad's least favourite type of person.

I think if there was a petition to ship all of the teenagers in the state to Australia or Alcatraz or something, Dad would be the first person to sign it.

And the first teenager he'd put on the boat would be this kid named Lenwood Heath. Lenwood is always toilet papering people's houses and generally stirring up trouble in the neighborhood.

Dad has seemed a lot more relaxed ever since August when Lenwood's dad shipped him off to some military academy in Pennsylvania.

While I'm on the subject of Saturday I should mention some of my other gripes. First of all, there's nothing on t.v. after 1:00 p.m. except golf and bowling. Second of all the sun comes right through the sliding glass window and you can hardly see what's on the t.v. anyway. And on top of that you get all sweaty and stick to the couch. It's practically like a consipracy against kids to make them go outside and do something besides watch t.v.

Today after Dad woke up I decided to just skip the whole t.v. thing and go over to Rowley's.

I know I haven't mentioned Rowley in this journal yet even though he's technically my best friend, but there's a pretty good reason for that.

Rowley kind of ticked me off on the first day of school with something he said at the end of the day when we were getting our stuff from our lockers.

I told Rowley at least a billion times this summer that now that we're in middle school you're supposed to say "hang out", not "play". But no matter how many times I kick him in the shins when he says "play" he always forgets for the next time.

So I guess you could say I've been avoiding Rowley this week. I've ben trying to be more careful about my image ever since this summer when we got caught playing Vikings and Indians in the woods by a couple of eighth graders.

What really burned me up about that whole incident is how that guy called me a nerd. Now I'll admit I'm not exactly the most macho guy around in terms of wanting to do push-ups all the time or whatever, so if you want to call me a wimp, then fine. But I know one thing for sure, and it's that I'm NOT a nerd.

The trouble with nerds is that they give wimpy kids like me a bad name, because people end up lumping us all in the same category. When I think of nerds, I think of teachers'pets and tickle fights and hall monitors, and that is not me.

Now Rowley can speak for himself on the whole "nerd" thing, but I will just mention as a side note that he is the only 12-year-old I know who still has a babysitter.

Rowley moved here a couple years ago and I kind of took him under my wing. My former best friend Ben moved to Piscataway and I figured I'd better find myself a new friend to hang out with, so here comes Rowley straight out of Ohio. His mom bought him some book called "How to Make Friends in New Places" and he showed up at my door trying out all these gimmicks.

All that kid would've had to have done is to have come right out and told me he had a Playstation with 42 games and it would have sealed the deal.

The best thing about having Rowley around is that I get a chance to use all the tricks Rodrick used on me that I could never get away with pulling on Manny.

Another bonus about Rowley is that he has never squealed on me, not even once. So in some ways I guess you could say he's the perfect friend.
