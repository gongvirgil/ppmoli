# Tuesday,September 7th

First of all, I want to get something straight:

this is a JOURNAL, not a diary. I know what it says on the cover but when Mom went out to buy this thing I SPECIFICALLY said to make sure it didn't say "diary" on it. So don't expect me to be all "dear diary this" and "dear diary that".

All I need for some jerk to catch me carrying this thing around and get the wrong idea.

The other thing I want to clear up right away is how this was NOT my idea, it was Moms.

The idea is that if I write in this book a little bit each day I get out of one chore on Saturdays, so of course I picked the one I hate most. But if Rodrick ever finds out he's scrubbing toilets because of this book, I'm dead.

Oh yeah Rodrick's my brother. I try to avoid him anyway but now that I struck this deal with Mom, I better be eatra careful.

Anyway I think Mom has this idea I'm going to write down my "feelings" and all that, but she's not actually allowed to read it so I figure I'll just write I want.

The real reason I agreed to do this at all is because I figure later on when I'm rich and famous I'll have better things to do than answer people's stupid questions all day long.

Like I said, one day I will definitely be famous, but for now I'm stuck in the seventh grade with a bunch of morons.

Today is the first day of school and right now we're just waiting around for the teacher to hurry up and finish the seating chart.

So I figured I might as well write in this book and just get it over with for the day.

But I'll tell you something... on the first day of school, you got to be real careful of where you sit. You walk into the classroom and just plunk your stuff down on any old desk and the next thing you know the teacher is saying

So in this class I got stuck with Chris Hosey in front of me and Lionel James in back of me.

Otha Harris came in late and almost sat right next to me but luckily I did some quick thinking and got myself out of that one.

I'm thinking for next period I should just sit in the middle of a bunch of cute girls as soon as I step in the room.

Then again if I do that it just proves that I didn't learn a thing from last year.

Plus the other thing I got think about is that girls don't let you copy off them, which could be a real problem in a class like Pre Algebra.

Speaking of seating, something that really stunk today is how in home room I got stuck with some teacher who had Rodrick in his class a few years back.

The only good thing I can think about the first day of school is that some of the teachers are new and so you can slide a little.

Anyway the teacher is almost done with the seating chart and I think I wrote enough in this book to keep Mom off my back for today.
